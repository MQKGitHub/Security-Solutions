## 🧱 Security Solutions

Explore fundamental defensive security solutions like firewalls, IDS, vulnerability scanners, and SIEM through different hands-on exercises.

This module introduces key tools and concepts used in defending networks. You’ll learn how firewalls filter traffic, how IDS systems detect threats, how SIEM platforms centralise security logs, and how vulnerability scanners find weaknesses.

### 🧠 Overview

### 📊 Introduction to SIEM  
- Learned what a SIEM is, how it ingests logs, and how correlation rules trigger alerts based on suspicious behaviour.  
- Explored dashboards, log sources, and how SOC analysts use SIEMs to detect, investigate, and respond to real-time threats.

### 🔥 Firewall Fundamentals  
- Learned how firewalls control network traffic using rules, covering types like stateless, stateful, proxy, and next-generation firewalls.  
- Practised creating and testing rules with Windows Defender Firewall and Linux `ufw`, gaining hands-on experience in securing system boundaries.

### 🛡️ IDS Fundamentals  
- Learned how IDS tools like Snort monitor traffic for suspicious behaviour using signature and anomaly-based detection.  
- Gained hands-on experience creating and testing custom Snort rules on live and recorded network traffic.
